# Sentinel Mod
Adds a inside enemy called the Sentinel, a giant robot that patrols halls and has guns.
it can dance to boomboxes,
and other cool stuff too! semi-passive but has a temper and will kill you.

<h3>I made my own API for this mod, called Aub's Piggyback Script. in the initial versions of this mod, it will be built-in, but in the future, i will make it its own thing. its powerful and unlike other API's does not break much between versions. This is not using any external APIs at all</h3>

<h5>Install Guide :</h5>

1. Install BepInEx

2. Put all the files in the zip file folder thing, into this path in your game:
Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins\SentinelMod, it should contain many files within the folder of that path.

3. Run the game and Done!

Alternate : Use a automatic mod launcher thingy
